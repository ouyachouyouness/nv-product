# API Rate Monetization

### Sample use case

#### API Monetization

* Defining, enabling and monitoring revenue for APIs 

* Defining monetization tiers and throttling traffic based on these tiers 

* Support for different API subscription models 

    * By call volume 

    * By Bandwidth Consumption

    * By time of day usage 

* For back-ends that are also monetized, create reports and compare against invoices from back-end vendors.

* Offer free trial version and ask to pay if they wish to continue the service for a long time 

### Business Story

You can add any custom subscription tires as well.

We can connect to a billing engine as mentioned in the following document[1] and connect the API manager node to the billing engine and charge according to the API usage and bandwidth consumption.

By using connecting the API Manager to the API Manager analytics server we can identify the API usages along with the billing engine outcomes.

Hence using the above mentioned subscription approach we can have a free subscription tier for free trail version users. Once they reach they can be offered the prices subscriptions which will gain the revenue.
